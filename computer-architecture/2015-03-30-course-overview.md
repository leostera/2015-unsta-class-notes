# Basic Concepts

- Definition of a Computer
- Architecture and Organization
â€“ Structure and function:
  1. Data Storage
  2. Data Processing
  3. Data Transferring
  4. Control (?

These are the four big divisions of computing.

A computer is composed by:
1. CPU
2. Memory
3. Communication Sistems (Buses, etc)
4. I/O Modules

Within these four big divisions of a computer, we can consider that:
1. The CPU is subdivided into:
  1. Registers
  2. Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU):
  3. Control Unit (CU)
    1. Sequential Logic
    2. Registers and Control Unit decodifiers
    3. Control Memory: which is mainly composed by registers.
  4. Internal wiring (System Buses)

# Evolution of Computers

There's 5 generations of computers.

0. Composed mainly by mechanical devices (begining of the 40s, WW2).

1. First decade after 1945 consisted of computers made of Valves! ENIAC
(Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) is a sample of it. Every digit
were formed by nine valves.

2. For the next decade after 1955 consisted of transistors. Transistors were 
accidentally discovered at AT&T's Bell Labs. 

3. Integrated Circuits appear. Take it from 1965 till the 80s

4. Big scale computers and personal computers.
